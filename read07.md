# Functions #

### Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it. ###
## example ##
### function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the product of p1 and p2 ###

 ## JavaScript Function Syntax ##
### A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses (). ###

### Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables). ###

### The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:###
### (parameter1, parameter2, ...) ###
