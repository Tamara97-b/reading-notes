## text ##
### The opening <html> tag indicates that anything between it and a closing </html> tag is HTML code.
### The <body> tag indicates that anything between it and the closing
### </body> tag should be shown inside the main browser window.
### Words between <h1> and </h1> are a main heading.
### A paragraph of text appears between these <p> and </p> tags.
### Words between <h2> and </h2> form a sub-heading.
### Here is another paragraph between opening <p> and closing </p> tags
## the loops ##
### Conditional statements allow your code to make
### decisions about what to do next.
### Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
### are used to compare two operands.
### Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
### set of comparison operators.
### if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
### if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
### switch statements allow you to compare a value
### against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
### option if none match).
### Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
### All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.
### There are three types of loop: for, while, and
### do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
## document object ##
### The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
### DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
### element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
### You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
### attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
### Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
### node, it will always return a Nadel i st.
### From an element node, you can access and update its
### content using properties such as textContent and
### i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
### An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
### child elements that are siblings of each other.
### In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is
### inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
### cBrowsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
## instruction ##
### A script is made up of a series of statements. Each
### statement is like a step in a recipe.
### Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
### you might specify that a value must be remembered
### before creating a calculation using that value.
### Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
### information used in the script.
### Arrays are special types of variables that store more
### than one piece of related information.
### JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
### strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false).
### Expressions evaluate into a single value.
### Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
# CSS # 
### treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside
### its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
### element should look.
### Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
### elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
### indicate what these elements should look like).
### Different types of selectors allow you to target your
### rules at different elements.
### Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
### of the element that you want to change, and the values
### of those properties. For example, the font-family
### property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
### specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
### CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
### although they may appear within an HTML page.
